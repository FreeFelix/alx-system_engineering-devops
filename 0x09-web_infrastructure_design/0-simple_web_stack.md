Server:
A server provides resources or services to clients over a network, handling specific tasks or requests.

Domain Name:
A domain name is a human-readable label that points to an IP address, allowing users to access resources using memorable names.

DNS Record for www:
The www typically represents a CNAME record in DNS, pointing to the main domain (e.g., foobar.com).

Web Server Role:
The web server handles HTTP requests, delivering web content like pages, images, and scripts to clients.

Application Server Role:
An application server processes backend logic for web applications, managing data processing and interactions.

Database Role:
The database stores structured data, serving as a central repository for persistent and accessible information.

Server-User Communication:
Servers communicate with users via HTTP or HTTPS protocols over the internet, using request-response interactions.

Issues:
SPOF:
A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a component whose failure can cause the entire system to fail, requiring redundancy measures.

Downtime for Maintenance:
Restarting servers for maintenance can cause downtime, affecting service availability and user experience.

Scalability Limitations:
Inadequate infrastructure may struggle with increased traffic, leading to performance issues or outages, necessitating scaling strategies.
